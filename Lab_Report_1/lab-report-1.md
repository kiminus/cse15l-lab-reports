### Create a new Project

Try to use VS code to write your lab report!

### How to do it?

First create your lab report folder then open VS code, and use vs code to open
this folder

![open_folder](<Lab Report 1 sources/open_folder.png>)

then, right click the empty space in the explore section, and in the dropdown
menu select `New File`

![create file](<Lab Report 1 sources/create_file.png>)

finally, rename the file name to your preference, and change the file extension
to `.md`, which is the markdown file

![make file](<Lab Report 1 sources/make_file.png>)

## Find your CSE 15L course account

After login, you can find your account shown here:

![Untitled](<Lab Report 1 sources/Untitled 1.png>)

### Forgot password?

- if you know your SSO password, donâ€™t reset it
  - it will change all your existing passwords
- if you forgot your password, you may reset it follow the instructions on this
  page
- go to IT desk if you need additional help (they are very helpful)

[[TUTORIAL] How to Reset your Password](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hs7CyQeh-MdUfM9uv99i8tqfneos6Y8bDU0uhn1wqho/edit)

# Connect to a Remote Server

1. open windows PowerShell (you can type `window powershell` in computer search
   bar and open it)
2. enter this
   command:`ssh _<the course specific account name>_ [@ieng6.ucsd.edu]`

- your terminal should look like this:
  `PS C:\Users\ <*your user name*> ssh <*the course specific account name*>[@ieng6.ucsd.edu]`

4. enter your course specific password (or your SSO password, by default)

> ðŸ’¡ The terminal will not display the password you entered. **DONT paste your
> password use `control + v`, it will input ^V, not your clipboard. Use right
> click instead**

if you login successfully, your terminal should look like that:

# Run some remote commands:

try to run some remote commands like these:

> `cd ~`

> `cd`

> `ls -lat`

> `ls -a`

> `ls <directory>`Â whereÂ `<directory>`Â isÂ `/home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/cs15lwi23abc`,
> where theÂ `abc`Â is one of the other group membersâ€™ username

> `cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/public/hello.txt ~/`

> `cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/public/hello.txt`

### example: run ls -lat:

your terminal should look like this:

![Untitled](<Lab Report 1 sources/Untitled%203.png>)
- the `ls` means to list all files
   - `-l` means list one file per line
   - `-a` means all files
   - `-t` means sort by modification time
- so the command means: list all files in the current directory by the modification time, and list one file per line
### Example 2: copy file to remote server (_REMOTE CONNECTING_)

copy the file `HW1.pdf` located at the `~/downloads` folder to the
`~/Homeworks/cse-20/` folder at the remote server
**`cs15lwi23akl@ieng6.ucsd.edu`**

1. first, we need to know what is the current working directory, we get that
   information by typing `pwd`
2. then, we need to make sure the destination directory path exist,
   1. we can login to the remote server and use `mkdir -p <path>` to create a
      path, and copy the file regularly
   - we have to use -p here because the parent directory does not exist, and
     `-p` will create all directories even if they do not exist
3. then, we need to copy that file
   1. we have two ways to locate that file
      1. change the wd to downloads and reference the file with its name
      2. or reference the file use relative path
4. finally use the `scp` statement

<aside>
> Note we CANNOT use cp command to copy a file to a remote server. we have to use scp to copy to a remote server

```powershell
#first get current local working directory
PS C:\Users\zilin> pwd

# unfortunately the directory does not exit, so we need to create a new directory use mkdir -p <path>
[cs15lwi23akl@ieng6-201]:~:60$ mkdir -p ~/Homeworks/cse-20/
# we can cd into the directory to make sure it is created
